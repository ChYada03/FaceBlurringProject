Face Detection & Blurring
Tools : Python, YOLOv8, OpenCV, Supervision, Gradio, Hugging Face

Developed an interactive face detection and blurring system using YOLOv8 for real-time processing

Implemented multiple blurring methods: Gaussian blur, pixelation, and emoji overlay

Utilized Gradio UI for an interactive interface allowing users to select faces to keep unblurred

Integrated Hugging Face Hub for model deployment and used Supervision for efficient face detecting
